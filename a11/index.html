<h2>A11 Black Hat White Hat<h2>

<p>The picture below is an example of a Black Hat 
  visualization because it obscures the upwards trend in the data by making the min and max values for the y axis very big.
  This makes it very hard to see that the temperature is slowly increasing. Also some people think 
  that a few degrees of warming wont make much of a difference and I think this graph reinforces this error.</p>

<p>- I fixed the obscuring of the data by making the min and max values of the y axis much smaller.<br>
  - I  changed the data from Fahrenheit to Celsius <br>
  - I change the y axis date from average temperature to change in temperature since 1880 <br>
  - Data source: https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/
</p>
<br>
<p>For the A requirement I decided to make a Black Hat visualization like the one above, except this one
  transforms into a White Hat visualization.<br>
  I think this allows the user to see how easy it is to obscure the data using bad min and max values.
