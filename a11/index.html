<p>The picture below is an example of a Black Hat 
  visualization because it obscures the trend in the data by making the y axis very big.
  This makes it very hard to see that the temperature is slowly increasing. Some people might think 
  that a few degrees of warming wont make much a difference and I think this graph reinforces this error.</p>

<p>I fixed the obscuring of the data by making the min and max values of the y axis much smaller.</p>

<p>For the A- requirement I decided to make a Black Hat visualization like the one above, except this one
  transforms into a White Hat visualization. The explanation is the same.
